# Elin State Tagging ‚Äì Deep Neural Network Training & Testing

MATLAB implementation for training and testing deep neural networks on **elin state tagging** data.  
Supports undersampling strategies, STFT-based feature extraction, mislabeled data correction, and iterative dataset generation.

---

## Quick Start

### Training
Run:
```matlab
elin_state_tagging_script.m
```
- Choose undersampling strategy (3 options).  
- Set number of iterations (STFT step = 1024 / input).  
- Select training/validation ratio (default 0.5).  
- Train new model or validate existing one.  
- Optionally correct mislabeled data.  

üí° Example: Input `4` ‚Üí step = 256 samples ‚Üí ~1h training.

### Testing
Run:
```matlab
elin_state_tagging_test_script.m
```
- Choose number of networks (default 3).  
- Select trained networks from folder.  
- Set iterations (same STFT method as training).  
  - ‚ö†Ô∏è Input `1024` ‚Üí testing with 1-sample step size ‚Üí very slow.  
- Training/validation ratio (default 0.5).  
- Optionally correct mislabeled data.
